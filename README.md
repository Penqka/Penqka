ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Penko Dimitrov,

I'm passionate about software engineering. With over 10 years of experience in TV broadcasting, IP and satellite video transmission systems, I have a solid background in technology and video production. Currently, I'm working at the biggest broadcast service company in Bulgaria, which has exhibited at IBC (Amsterdam) twice.

Apart from my experience in newsgathering and camerawork, I've also edited videos for a number of YouTube channels, two of which I started from scratch and grew to 100k subscribers. Currently, I'm learning software engineering through the Python path at SoftUni (https://softuni.bg) and I'm eager to transition my skills to the software field.

As a Junior Software Developer, I'm excited to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to real-world challenges. I'm a quick learner, a team player, and committed to delivering high-quality work. If you're interested in learning more about me or have any opportunities you'd like to discuss, please don't hesitate to contact me at dim.penko@gmail.com.
